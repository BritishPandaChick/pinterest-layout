        <p>“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
          marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
          friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
          to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
          cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she beyond
          youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego
          every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint
          the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable
          elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the
          effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection,
          I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward;
          and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and
          the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward
          in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it,
          as any father could do, in such a matter.” </p>
